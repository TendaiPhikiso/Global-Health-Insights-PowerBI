Analysing Alcohol Disorders, Road Injuries, and Cardiovascular Mortality Patterns Globally.


### Case study Questions
- *Are countries with higher rates of alcohol consumption experiencing higher mortality rates from alcohol use disorders?*

- *Is there a correlation between road quality and the mortality rate due to road injuries across different countries? How does this relationship vary when considering population density and other demographic factors (Alcohol or drug abuse rates)?*

- *Which continent had the highest mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases over the period 1990-2019, and how does it correlate with population growth in that region?*
